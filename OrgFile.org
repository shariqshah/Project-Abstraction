* ChangeLog
** <2014-12-14 Sun 20:41>

- Added support for responding to collisions detected by bullet by calling 'onCollision' method
  of every script attached to the gameobject and passing the relevant collision data to the
  method, which includes the gameobject colliding with and the world-space location.

- Models that are not attached to any gameobject as nodes are now added to a list on creation
  and are removed from the game on cleanup. The caller does not need to do the cleanup anymore
  which means the can be called from scripts as well.

- Add support for setting renderer's flag on any node.

- Models that are added to scene only as collision meshes or that are not attached to any 
  gameobject as component do not show up in the scene anymore as their flag is set to 
  'INACTIVE'

- Added support for loading/unloading/using textures by using SDL_Image
- Created and fixed new and previous memory leaks with valgrind.
** <2015-01-02 Fri>

- Added further functionality to model related procedures. The render loop is almost complete.
- Re-wrote most of the scenemanager related procedures by removing all horde3d things. 
  It uses flat arrays(currently c++ vector) for storing gameobjects.
* Tasks
** High-level
*** TODO Renderer
Replace Horde3d with custom renderer implemented in Opengl. The renderer only needs to be as complex as i need it to be.
*** TODO Squirrel mode for emacs?
*** TODO GUI
Add GUI by using IMGUI tuts.
*** TODO Render to texture
Last step before moving on to CPU!
*** TODO CPU
*** TODO World/Terrain generation?
*** TODO Replace all 'c++' stuff with custom or 'c' stuff. C-ify All The Things!
*** TODO ???
*** TODO Profit!

* Notes
** <2014-12-14 Sun 21:21>
This is the first entry into my "OrgFile.org". The plan is to have a seperate OrgFile for every project that i work on, although i might change that in that in the future.
The file is divided into three major parts,
- Changelog
  Contains day to day developments
- Tasks
  Contains list of things to do, divided into high-level and day to day tasks.
  - High-Level
	List of high level things to do that span the full length of the project.
  - Day to Day
	List of things arranged by timestamp. Contains TODO lists of things that come up and day-to-day work but are not major enough to be included in High-Level list.
- Notes
  Contains a list on notes arranged by timestamps. Each note may contain things related to the current project but it is not necessay. The notes section serves more as a 
  journal or a blog.

I hope i keep this habit up! After several(failed) attempts in the past to maintain a journal i hope i can finally do better this time!
  
** <2014-12-21 Sun>
Removed all static state variables from unnamed namespaces by simply removing the 'static' from them.
I expected to see alot of errors but was pleasantly surprised when the buid completed successfully.
Also removed all the various "executeFunction" variants from scriptengine. I figured a little bit of template magic won't
hurt any one. And they worked as expected. Now, instead of having eight or nine different variants of the same "executeFunction"
function i have only one that serves my current needs and any future ones if needed and it looks much cleaner and takes far 
less lines. All those repetitive code took around ninety lines and the current one takes only ten!

Much less progress today since i only worked for about ten minutes but anything is better than nothing!
** <2014-12-30 Tue>
I have started with the proces of replacing Horde3d as the renderer and replacing it with my own
custom renderer. The new renderer will be as simple/complex as i want it to be so i won't have anymore
problems figuring out how to add/remove/modify anything should the need arise. This will not only remove
a dependency from the codebase but also simplify things to a large degree.

I've also started to transition to codebase to a more simpler c-style. I have always been interested in
learing more about and C and getting close to the metal and since Project Abstraction is largely about
me learning about how things work, i thought why not! I do realize this will slow things down further
but i'm in no particular hurry anyway.

P.S. My writing and composition is horrible. I hope this note-taking can make it better!
** <2015-01-02 Fri>
So i finally re-wrote the scenemanger. It was on the list of many things that i've been putting off to 
write later. The scenemanager now uses flat arrays instead of unordered hashmap like it used to. It
remains to be seen whether this will give me better performance or not. There is one thing however that
i still haven't been able to figure out, which arises from my current implementations of using flat 
arrays for storage. Since the size of the arrays is not fixed, everytime the array increases in size,
pointers to current objects inside the array are invalidated because the resize causes reallocation.

At the moment this isn't such a big issue but in the future this might cause some problems and headache
i suspect!
