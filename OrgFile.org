* ChangeLog
** <2014-12-14 Sun 20:41>
- Added support for responding to collisions detected by bullet by calling 'onCollision' method
  of every script attached to the gameobject and passing the relevant collision data to the
  method, which includes the gameobject colliding with and the world-space location.

- Models that are not attached to any gameobject as nodes are now added to a list on creation
  and are removed from the game on cleanup. The caller does not need to do the cleanup anymore
  which means the can be called from scripts as well.

- Add support for setting renderer's flag on any node.

- Models that are added to scene only as collision meshes or that are not attached to any 
  gameobject as component do not show up in the scene anymore as their flag is set to 
  'INACTIVE'
** <2014-12-30 Tue>
- Added support for loading/unloading/using textures by using SDL_Image
- Created and fixed new and previous memory leaks with valgrind.
** <2015-01-02 Fri>
- Added further functionality to model related procedures. The render loop is almost complete.
- Re-wrote most of the scenemanager related procedures by removing all horde3d things. 
  It uses flat arrays(currently c++ vector) for storing gameobjects.
** <2015-01-04 Sun>
- Implemented rendering of meshes.
- Implemented camera for viewing scene.
- Slightly modified previous code for freecamera to work with current version.
** <2015-01-04 Sun>
- Refactored code from Component Manager to GameObject namespace.
- Component creation/retrieval and removal will be done through GO namespace and Component Manager will be discarded
** <2015-01-05 Mon>
- Implemented per model material setting by adding a new stuct called materialuniforms to every model.
- Unshaded material can now use per mode material information. For Unshaded material it is currently only diffuse.
** <2015-01-08 Thu>
- Fixed bugs with vertexcolors, uvs and normals not being sent to gpu when creating VBOs for model.
- Fixed bugs with texture createion and texture mapping.
** <2015-01-09 Fri>
- Created custom format for exporting meshes from blender to Project Abstraction
- Created addon for blender to export currently selected mesh to (.pamesh)
- Created importer that will import (.pamesh) files.
** <2015-01-13 Tue>
- Fixed blender exporter
** <2015-01-17 Sat>
- Implemented unshadedtextured material.
- Implmented reuse of textures. If a texture is already loaded it won't be loaded again, existing index
  will be returned instead.
- Added reference counting to textures.
- Implemnted phong material.
- Added simple shading and lighting and implemented spot, directional and point lights.
- Added ambientlight and fog.
** <2015-01-20 Tue>
- Added shader preprocessing that looks for "//include" in shader file and includes the space seperated files.

** <2015-01-21 Wed>
- Implemented phong textured material.
** <2015-01-22 Thu>
- Added fog and ambientLight to unshaded materials
- Compacted material.cpp code
- Fixed binding generation everywhere

* Notes
** <2014-12-14 Sun 21:21>
This is the first entry into my "OrgFile.org". The plan is to have a seperate OrgFile for every project that i work on, although i might change that in that in the future.
The file is divided into three major parts,
- Changelog
  Contains day to day developments
- Tasks
  Contains list of things to do, divided into high-level and day to day tasks.
  - High-Level
	List of high level things to do that span the full length of the project.
  - Day to Day
	List of things arranged by timestamp. Contains TODO lists of things that come up and day-to-day work but are not major enough to be included in High-Level list.
- Notes
  Contains a list on notes arranged by timestamps. Each note may contain things related to the current project but it is not necessay. The notes section serves more as a 
  journal or a blog.

I hope i keep this habit up! After several(failed) attempts in the past to maintain a journal i hope i can finally do better this time!
  
** <2014-12-21 Sun>
Removed all static state variables from unnamed namespaces by simply removing the 'static' from them.
I expected to see alot of errors but was pleasantly surprised when the buid completed successfully.
Also removed all the various "executeFunction" variants from scriptengine. I figured a little bit of template magic won't
hurt any one. And they worked as expected. Now, instead of having eight or nine different variants of the same "executeFunction"
function i have only one that serves my current needs and any future ones if needed and it looks much cleaner and takes far 
less lines. All those repetitive code took around ninety lines and the current one takes only ten!

Much less progress today since i only worked for about ten minutes but anything is better than nothing!
** <2014-12-30 Tue>
I have started with the proces of replacing Horde3d as the renderer and replacing it with my own
custom renderer. The new renderer will be as simple/complex as i want it to be so i won't have anymore
problems figuring out how to add/remove/modify anything should the need arise. This will not only remove
a dependency from the codebase but also simplify things to a large degree.

I've also started to transition to codebase to a more simpler c-style. I have always been interested in
learing more about and C and getting close to the metal and since Project Abstraction is largely about
me learning about how things work, i thought why not! I do realize this will slow things down further
but i'm in no particular hurry anyway.

P.S. My writing and composition is horrible. I hope this note-taking can make it better!
** <2015-01-02 Fri>
So i finally re-wrote the scenemanger. It was on the list of many things that i've been putting off to 
write later. The scenemanager now uses flat arrays instead of unordered hashmap like it used to. It
remains to be seen whether this will give me better performance or not. There is one thing however that
i still haven't been able to figure out, which arises from my current implementations of using flat 
arrays for storage. Since the size of the arrays is not fixed, everytime the array increases in size,
pointers to current objects inside the array are invalidated because the resize causes reallocation.

At the moment this isn't such a big issue but in the future this might cause some problems and headache
i suspect!
** <2015-01-05 Mon>
After a lot of dilly dally i finally managed to come up with a very simple solution to setting per model
material properties which include diffuse, texture etc. I implemented it by having a single struct inside
each model that has various properties. At render time these properties are set depending on the material
of the model. For example, if a model has "unshaded" material, only it's "diffuseColor" property will be set.
No need for inheritance etc like i was doing in ProjectNGE.

KISS is working well so far! Let's hope this continues.
** <2015-01-09 Fri>
So i finally came to a stage where i realized in order to move forward i need to have
the ability to import meshes into the game. I could have used an existing format for that,
.obj comes to mind first as it is something i have used before and is rather simple to parse.

But since this project is all about learning, i decided to come up with my own simple format 
that does exactly what i want and is easy and fast to load as well. The format is 
called (.pamesh) or Project Abstraction Mesh. Currently it supports exporting

- Vertices
- Normals
- Indices
- UVs

of a selected mesh to binary. I plan on adding material support as well. If this goes well i
might even add component support later on if i need it. Since Project Abstraction is going to
be procedurally generated, i don't have need of a level editor just yet.
