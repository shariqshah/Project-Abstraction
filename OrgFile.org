* ChangeLog
** <2014-12-14 Sun 20:41>

- Added support for responding to collisions detected by bullet by calling 'onCollision' method
  of every script attached to the gameobject and passing the relevant collision data to the
  method, which includes the gameobject colliding with and the world-space location.

- Models that are not attached to any gameobject as nodes are now added to a list on creation
  and are removed from the game on cleanup. The caller does not need to do the cleanup anymore
  which means the can be called from scripts as well.

- Add support for setting renderer's flag on any node.

- Models that are added to scene only as collision meshes or that are not attached to any 
  gameobject as component do not show up in the scene anymore as their flag is set to 
  'INACTIVE'

**** DONE  Collision Response by using contact manifold
	 - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-12-14 Sun 21:02]
**** TODO  Create bindings for seting default viewer of a scene/game.
**** TODO  Save script container index for a particular gameobject inside the gameobject struct for faster lookup of gameobject in script manager.
**** DONE Rigidbody collision filtering by using layer and ability to switch them.
	 - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-12-21 Sun 01:49]
**** TODO  Remove all static state variables from anonymous namespaces.
**** TODO  Scaling collision meshes?

	 Could be done by applying transformation to model serving as collision mesh or maybe bullet has something built-in?

* Notes

This is the first entry into my "OrgFile.org". The plan is to have a seperate OrgFile for every project that i work on, although i might change that in that in the future.
The file is divided into three major parts,
- Changelog
  Contains day to day developments
- Tasks
  Contains list of things to do, divided into high-level and day to day tasks.
  - High-Level
	List of high level things to do that span the full length of the project.
  - Day to Day
	List of things arranged by timestamp. Contains TODO lists of things that come up and day-to-day work but are not major enough to be included in High-Level list.
- Notes
  Contains a list on notes arranged by timestamps. Each note may contain things related to the current project but it is not necessay. The notes section serves more as a 
  journal or a blog.

I hope i keep this habit up! After several(failed) attempts in the past to maintain a journal i hope i can finally do better this time!

Removed all static state variables from unnamed namespaces by simply removing the 'static' from them.
I expected to see alot of errors but was pleasantly surprised when the buid completed successfully.
Also removed all the various "executeFunction" variants from scriptengine. I figured a little bit of template magic won't
hurt any one. And they worked as expected. Now, instead of having eight or nine different variants of the same "executeFunction"
function i have only one that serves my current needs and any future ones if needed and it looks much cleaner and takes far 
less lines. All those repetitive code took around ninety lines and the current one takes only ten!

Much less progress today since i only worked for about ten minutes but anything is better than nothing!
